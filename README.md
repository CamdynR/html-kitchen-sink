# html-kitchen-sink
All of HTML5 in one big kitchen sink demo. 

Provide simple examples of all the HTML tags with content that describes the purposes of the tags or constructs where possible.  The page is not meant to be realistic but it is meant to provide a complete overview of what is available.  While the demo is complete in basic coverage, for detailed coverage links are provided to associated specifications or demos.

This is a teaching repository in support of classes at UC San Diego including CSE134B, CSE135, DSC106, and software engineering classes when web technologies are employed.

Students interested in contributing or modifying content should create a pull request or speak to Prof. Powell about proposed changes.
